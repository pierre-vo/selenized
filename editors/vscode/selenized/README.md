# bloertscher-selenized
This is a color theme based on [Jan Warchol's Selenized](https://github.com/jan-warchol/selenized).
I've switched some of the token colors and added a few extra colors to the palette for vscode UI elements, such as the file tree.
The light themes don't look very good yet, but the dark and black themes are ok.
